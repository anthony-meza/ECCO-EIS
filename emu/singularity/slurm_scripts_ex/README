In this directory are pbs* scripts that 
are configured to be used with a SLURM scheduler. 

To get this to run with EMU, install EMU as normal. 

Then, you may copy these files over to
EMU_DIR/emu_userinterace. 

To configure these files, you must run ./emu_env.sh again. 

Finally, some pbs* scripts may require you to specify a number of nodes and even wall hours. These can be located at: 

1. emu_dir/emu/emu_input/nproc/{NPROCS}/PBS_nodes

Below is an example of PBS_nodes for NPROCS = 96, which you can 
use to replace PBS_TASKS with this set of CP:
PBS -l select=3:ncpus=40:model=sky_ele

Which, equivalently would be 
#SBATCH --nodes=3
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40
But keep in mind each system is different, so --ntasks-per-node may vary as well. 

2. emu_dir/emu/emu_input/nproc/{NPROCS}/mitgcm_timing.nml

Below is an example of mitgcm_timing.nml for NPROC=96:
&mitgcm_timing
  nproc = 96
  hour26yr_trc =   4 (hours for the tracer tool)
  hour26yr_fwd =  18 (hours for the forward gradient tool)
  hour26yr_adj = 162  (hours for the adjoint tool)
